# N-bodies_2D
A small scale simulation of n-bodies with centre of mass frame of reference with collisons

## Features: 
  1. Vaious frames of reference:
       1. Center of Mass
       2. Any Body of choice.
       3.  Absolute
  2. Energy Analysis
  3. Pairwise motion Analysis

## Things needs to be worked upon:
  1. Inefficiency with large number of bodies
  2.  Implementation of Euler Algorithm
  3.  Extendng to 3rd Dimension

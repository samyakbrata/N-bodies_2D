# N-bodies_2D
A small scale simulation of n-bodies with centre of mass frame of reference with collisons

## Features: 
  1. Vaious frames of reference available:
       a. Center of Mass
       b. Any Body of choice
       c. Absolute
  3. Energy Analysis
  4. Pairwise motion Analysis

## Things needs to be worked upon:
  1. Inefficiency with large number of bodies
  2.  Implementation of Euler Algorithm
  3.  Extendng to 3rd Dimension
